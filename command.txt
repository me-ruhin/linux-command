> Create a user with user group:  
  sudo useradd -m newuser
  
> Create two directories in the user's home directory named os-concepts and ubuntu-is-the-best: 
  mkdir /home/newuser/os-concepts 
  mkdir /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best
  
> Create two files in each directory: 
  touch /home/newuser/os-concepts/file1.txt 
  touch /home/newuser/os-concepts/file2.txt 
  touch /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best/file1.txt 
  touch /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best/file2.txt
  
> List the files with detailed information (including file permission): 
  ls -al /home/newuser/os-concepts 
  ls -al /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best
  
> Update file permissions so that the owner can read and write, the group can only read, and others can't do anything: 
  chmod 640 /home/newuser/os-concepts/file1.txt
  chmod 640 /home/newuser/os-concepts/file2.txt
  chmod 640 /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best/file1.txt
  chmod 640 /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best/file2.txt
  
> Create another group:
  sudo groupadd newgroup

> Update file ownership to the newly created group:
  chown :newgroup /home/newuser/os-concepts/file1.txt
  chown :newgroup /home/newuser/os-concepts/file2.txt
  chown :newgroup /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best/file1.txt
  chown :newgroup /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best/file2.txt

> Add the user to the new group:
 sudo usermod -aG newgroup newuser

> Create a file called crash.in (file should contain the word "crash" in it) in different directories and then find the file in all locations using the find command:
  echo "crash" > /home/newuser/os-concepts/crash.in
  echo "crash" > /home/newuser/ubuntu-is-the-best/crash.in
  find /home/newuser -type f -name "crash.in"

> Replace the lines with "crash" to "broken" in all files using sed and xargs:
  find /home/newuser -type f -name "crash.in" -exec sed -i 's/crash/broken/g' {} \;
